* Modifying labs


1. Clone the repository on your computer.
2. If you are modifying an existing lab, say, *labXX.org*:
  1. Modify the *labXX-solution.lisp* file that you have on your computer.
  2. Change *labXX-test.lisp* and ensure your lab solution passes all test cases
  3. Replace *labXX-test.lisp* in the repository.
3. If you are creating a new lab, say, *labXX.org*:
  1. Create the lab solution in your *labXX-solution.lisp* file.
  2. Create your *labXX-test.lisp* and ensure your lab solution passes
     all test cases. Use other labs as a template. Notice that you
     must create a top level function called =test-labXX= that calls
     the test cases you have created.
  3. Add the reference to *labXX-test.lisp* in *cps305-utils.asd*
  4. Add the clause =(:labXX (test-labXX))= to the body of the case form in the =run-tests= function in *utils.lisp*
  5. Upload *labXX-test.lisp* to the repository, and update *cps305-utils.asd* and *utils.lisp* in the repository
